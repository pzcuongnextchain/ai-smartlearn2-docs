# User Management Requirements

## Feature Overview
Sub-administrator capability to manage students and instructors within organizational scope, including simplified profiles, bulk operations, and secure authentication with SHA256 encryption.

## User Story
As a sub-administrator, I want to manage students and instructors with simplified profiles and secure authentication, so that I can efficiently handle user accounts within my organization while maintaining data security.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Student Management
1. WHEN managing student profiles THEN the system SHALL display only: Name, ID, Password, Instructor, Course Schedule, Login Token
2. WHEN displaying passwords THEN the system SHALL show masked format (*******)
3. WHEN storing passwords THEN the system SHALL use SHA256 encryption with proper salting
4. WHEN creating students THEN the system SHALL generate unique login tokens automatically
5. WHEN editing student information THEN the system SHALL maintain audit trail of all changes

### Student Bulk Operations
1. WHEN performing bulk student registration THEN the system SHALL support CSV/Excel file upload with validation
2. WHEN bulk importing THEN the system SHALL validate: unique IDs, proper email formats, required fields completion
3. WHEN import errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error report with line-by-line feedback
4. WHEN bulk operations complete THEN the system SHALL generate summary report with success/failure counts
5. WHEN downloading student lists THEN the system SHALL export current student data in standardized format

### Instructor Management
1. WHEN managing instructor profiles THEN the system SHALL allow editing of: Name, ID, Password, Contact Information
2. WHEN instructors are created THEN the system SHALL assign organizational scope automatically
3. WHEN instructor information is updated THEN the system SHALL use SHA256 password encryption
4. WHEN instructor accounts are active THEN the system SHALL ensure they see only their assigned students
5. WHEN instructor permissions are set THEN the system SHALL restrict access to other organizational menus

### Student-Instructor Assignment
1. WHEN assigning students to instructors THEN the system SHALL support individual and bulk assignment operations
2. WHEN instructor assignments change THEN the system SHALL update student access permissions accordingly
3. WHEN viewing assignments THEN the system SHALL display clear instructor-student relationships
4. WHEN managing workload THEN the system SHALL show student count per instructor for balanced distribution
5. WHEN instructors access system THEN the system SHALL filter student lists to show only their assigned students

### Learning Progress Access
1. WHEN viewing student learning progress THEN the system SHALL display AI-recommended video lecture lists (same as current system)
2. WHEN accessing practice tool content THEN the system SHALL show simplified view with only "Use AI tool" page (removing task instruction and report pages)
3. WHEN reviewing assignments THEN the system SHALL display only "Use AI tool" page content for evaluation
4. WHEN monitoring progress THEN the system SHALL track completion across videos, practice sessions, and assignments
5. WHEN generating progress reports THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive learning analytics per student

## Business Rules

### Data Isolation and Security
- All user management operations are scoped to sub-administrator's organization
- Student and instructor data cannot be accessed across organizations
- Login tokens are unique system-wide to prevent conflicts
- Password changes require immediate re-encryption with SHA256

### Profile Simplification
- Removed fields: Age, Work Field, Position, Learning Goals, Basic Information
- Pre-survey related data is completely eliminated
- Focus on essential information for learning management
- Streamlined interface for faster user management operations

### Access Control
- Instructors have read-only access to their assigned students
- Instructors cannot access administrative functions or other organizational data
- Students can only access content assigned by their organization
- Cross-organizational access is strictly prohibited

## Technical Requirements

### User Authentication System
1. WHEN users log in THEN the system SHALL validate credentials against SHA256 encrypted passwords
2. WHEN login tokens are generated THEN the system SHALL ensure uniqueness and proper expiration handling
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL implement proper rate limiting and security measures
4. WHEN sessions are managed THEN the system SHALL maintain organizational context throughout user session

### Bulk Import Processing
1. WHEN processing bulk imports THEN the system SHALL handle large files (up to 10,000 students) efficiently
2. WHEN validating import data THEN the system SHALL check for duplicates within organization and system-wide
3. WHEN import operations run THEN the system SHALL provide real-time progress indicators
4. WHEN errors occur during import THEN the system SHALL continue processing valid records and report errors

### Password Security Implementation
1. WHEN passwords are stored THEN the system SHALL use SHA256 with unique salt per password
2. WHEN passwords are updated THEN the system SHALL invalidate old hashes and generate new ones
3. WHEN displaying passwords THEN the system SHALL never show actual passwords, only masked format
4. WHEN password policies are enforced THEN the system SHALL require minimum complexity standards

### Data Export and Reporting
1. WHEN exporting user data THEN the system SHALL exclude sensitive information like passwords and tokens
2. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide organizational-level user statistics
3. WHEN creating backups THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity while respecting organizational boundaries
4. WHEN auditing user actions THEN the system SHALL log all administrative operations with timestamps
