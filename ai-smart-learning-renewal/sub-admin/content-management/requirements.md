# Content Management Requirements

## Feature Overview
Sub-administrator capability to manage recommended videos, practice sessions, and AI-enabled content with organizational scope isolation.

## User Story
As a sub-administrator, I want to manage recommended videos and practice sessions with AI-enabled content analysis, so that the system can provide intelligent recommendations to students within my organization.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Recommended Video Management (Sessions 1-40)
1. WHEN accessing video management THEN the system SHALL provide 40 session slots for configuration
2. WHEN adding video content THEN the system SHALL allow registration of script content and hashtags for AI analysis
3. WHEN uploading videos THEN the system SHALL support thumbnail upload and content categorization
4. WHEN configuring sessions THEN the system SHALL provide unique URLs for each sub-administrator organization
5. WHEN managing video priority THEN the system SHALL remove priority system and rely on AI-driven recommendations

### AI Content Analysis Integration
1. WHEN registering video content THEN the system SHALL allow adding script content for AI processing
2. WHEN adding hashtags THEN the system SHALL support multiple tags for content categorization
3. WHEN content is analyzed THEN the system SHALL prepare data for RAG methodology implementation
4. WHEN videos are recommended THEN the system SHALL use registered content and scripts for AI matching
5. WHEN content is updated THEN the system SHALL re-process for AI recommendation engine

### Practice Session Configuration (Sessions 1-40)
1. WHEN setting up practice sessions THEN the system SHALL provide 40 session slots similar to video management
2. WHEN configuring practice tools THEN the system SHALL allow selection from available AI tools per session
3. WHEN setting pre-practice messages THEN the system SHALL provide HTML editor for rich content formatting
4. WHEN generating practice URLs THEN the system SHALL create unique URLs per organization and session
5. WHEN managing tools THEN the system SHALL respect super administrator's master control settings

### Assignment Management (Assignments 1-10)
1. WHEN creating assignments THEN the system SHALL provide 10 assignment slots with same structure as practice sessions
2. WHEN configuring assignments THEN the system SHALL allow tool selection and message customization
3. WHEN students access assignments THEN the system SHALL display only configured tools for that assignment
4. WHEN assignment is completed THEN the system SHALL track progress and provide feedback
5. WHEN managing assignment content THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency with practice session structure

### Initial Chat Message Configuration
1. WHEN setting up AI recommendation chat THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of initial greeting message
2. WHEN customizing messages THEN the system SHALL support personalization variables (student name, session content)
3. WHEN messages are displayed THEN the system SHALL show organization-specific branding and content
4. WHEN updating messages THEN the system SHALL apply changes immediately to new chat sessions
5. WHEN formatting messages THEN the system SHALL support HTML editor with rich text capabilities

## Business Rules

### Content Isolation
- All content management is scoped to sub-administrator's organization
- Videos and sessions cannot be shared across organizations without super admin approval
- Content URLs include organizational identifiers for proper routing
- AI analysis data is kept separate per organization

### AI Integration Requirements
- Script content must be provided for effective AI recommendations
- Hashtags should follow standardized taxonomy for better matching
- Content analysis results are used exclusively within organization scope
- RAG methodology implementation requires structured content format

### Session and Assignment Structure
- Practice sessions and assignments follow identical configuration patterns
- Tool availability depends on super administrator's master control settings
- Pre-practice messages are mandatory for user guidance
- URLs must be unique and secure per organization

## Technical Requirements

### Content Storage and Processing
1. WHEN content is uploaded THEN the system SHALL store with organizational tagging
2. WHEN processing for AI THEN the system SHALL maintain content security and isolation
3. WHEN generating URLs THEN the system SHALL include organizational context and security tokens
4. WHEN content is accessed THEN the system SHALL validate organizational permissions

### AI Content Analysis Pipeline
1. WHEN script content is added THEN the system SHALL process for keyword extraction and semantic analysis
2. WHEN hashtags are assigned THEN the system SHALL validate against organizational taxonomy
3. WHEN content is updated THEN the system SHALL trigger re-analysis pipeline
4. WHEN AI recommendations are generated THEN the system SHALL use processed content metadata

### URL Generation and Security
1. WHEN generating session URLs THEN the system SHALL include: organization ID, session ID, security hash
2. WHEN URLs are accessed THEN the system SHALL validate organizational context and user permissions
3. WHEN URLs expire THEN the system SHALL provide renewal mechanism for active sessions
4. WHEN sharing URLs THEN the system SHALL maintain security while allowing legitimate access

## Content Management Interface Requirements

### Video Management Interface
- Session-based organization (1-40 tabs or sections)
- Drag-and-drop video upload with progress indicators
- Script content editor with syntax highlighting
- Hashtag management with auto-suggestions

- Tool configuration per session
- Preview mode for testing session setup

### Assignment Interface
- Assignment creation wizard (1-10 slots)
- Tool selection and configuration

## Success Metrics
- Content upload success rate > 98%
- AI analysis processing time < 2 minutes per video
- Session URL generation time < 5 seconds
- Zero cross-organizational content access incidents
- Content management task completion time reduced by 40%
