# Assignment Management Requirements

## Feature Overview
Sub-administrator capability to create and manage assignments (1-10 slots) with AI tool integration, following the same structure as practice sessions but focused on assessment and evaluation.

## User Story
As a sub-administrator, I want to create and manage assignments with AI tool integration, so that I can assess student learning and provide structured evaluation opportunities within my organization.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Assignment Creation and Configuration (Slots 1-10)
1. WHEN sub-administrator creates assignments THEN the system SHALL provide 10 assignment slots with same structure as practice sessions
2. WHEN configuring assignments THEN the system SHALL allow tool selection from available AI tools per assignment
3. WHEN setting assignment parameters THEN the system SHALL define: title, description, due date, grading criteria, AI tools allowed
4. WHEN creating assignment instructions THEN the system SHALL provide HTML editor for rich content formatting
5. WHEN generating assignment URLs THEN the system SHALL create unique URLs per organization and assignment

### AI Tool Integration for Assignments
1. WHEN selecting AI tools for assignments THEN the system SHALL respect super administrator's master control settings
2. WHEN students access assignments THEN the system SHALL display only configured tools for that specific assignment
3. WHEN tools are configured THEN the system SHALL allow different tool sets per assignment based on learning objectives
4. WHEN assignment is submitted THEN the system SHALL capture all AI tool interactions and outputs for evaluation
5. WHEN managing tool access THEN the system SHALL support time-limited access during assignment period

### Assignment Submission and Tracking
1. WHEN students complete assignments THEN the system SHALL capture: AI tool usage, prompts entered, outputs generated, time spent
2. WHEN assignment is submitted THEN the system SHALL store complete interaction history for instructor review
3. WHEN tracking progress THEN the system SHALL show assignment status: not started, in progress, submitted, graded
4. WHEN managing deadlines THEN the system SHALL support automatic submission at due date with partial completion
5. WHEN viewing submissions THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive view of student work and AI tool usage

### Grading and Evaluation System
1. WHEN instructors grade assignments THEN the system SHALL provide interface to review AI tool interactions and outputs
2. WHEN evaluating submissions THEN the system SHALL display: prompt quality, tool usage effectiveness, learning objectives met
3. WHEN providing feedback THEN the system SHALL support detailed comments on specific AI interactions
4. WHEN calculating grades THEN the system SHALL support multiple grading criteria: prompt engineering, tool selection, output quality
5. WHEN assignments are graded THEN the system SHALL notify students and provide detailed feedback

### Assignment Analytics and Reporting
1. WHEN viewing assignment analytics THEN the system SHALL display: submission rates, average scores, tool usage patterns, common challenges
2. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide assignment-specific performance data for organizational analysis
3. WHEN monitoring student progress THEN the system SHALL identify students needing additional support
4. WHEN analyzing tool effectiveness THEN the system SHALL show which AI tools contribute most to learning outcomes
5. WHEN exporting results THEN the system SHALL support grade export for external learning management systems

## Business Rules

### Assignment Structure
- Assignments follow identical configuration pattern to practice sessions (1-40)
- Each assignment can use different AI tool combinations
- Assignment URLs are unique per organization with security tokens
- Due dates and time limits are enforced automatically

### Evaluation Criteria
- Assignments focus on assessment rather than open practice
- AI tool usage is tracked and evaluated as part of learning objectives
- Prompt engineering skills are assessed through interaction quality
- Output evaluation considers both technical accuracy and learning demonstration

### Academic Integrity
- All AI tool interactions are logged for academic integrity review
- Submission timestamps are recorded and enforced
- Collaboration policies can be configured per assignment
- Plagiarism detection considers AI-generated content appropriately

## Technical Requirements

### Assignment Workflow Engine
1. WHEN assignments are created THEN the system SHALL generate workflow with defined stages: creation, publication, submission, grading, feedback
2. WHEN managing assignment lifecycle THEN the system SHALL support draft, active, closed, archived states
3. WHEN handling submissions THEN the system SHALL ensure atomic operations for data integrity
4. WHEN processing evaluations THEN the system SHALL maintain audit trail of all grading actions

### AI Tool Integration Architecture
1. WHEN integrating AI tools THEN the system SHALL use same infrastructure as practice sessions with assignment-specific configurations
2. WHEN capturing interactions THEN the system SHALL store detailed logs without compromising student privacy
3. WHEN managing tool access THEN the system SHALL implement time-based permissions and usage limits
4. WHEN processing submissions THEN the system SHALL compile comprehensive interaction reports

### Grading Interface System
1. WHEN instructors access grading THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive view of student AI interactions
2. WHEN reviewing submissions THEN the system SHALL support side-by-side comparison of prompts and outputs
3. WHEN providing feedback THEN the system SHALL allow inline comments on specific interactions
4. WHEN calculating final grades THEN the system SHALL support weighted scoring across multiple criteria
