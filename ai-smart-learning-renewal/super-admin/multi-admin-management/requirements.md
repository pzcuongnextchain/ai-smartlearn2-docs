# Multi-Administrator Management Requirements

## Feature Overview
Super administrator capability to create and manage multiple sub-administrators with complete system oversight and control.

## User Story
As a super administrator, I want to create and manage multiple sub-administrators with isolated data access, so that different organizations can use the platform independently while maintaining data security.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Sub-Administrator Creation
1. WHEN super administrator creates a sub-administrator THEN the system SHALL create an isolated environment with separate data scope
2. WHEN sub-administrator account is created THEN the system SHALL generate unique organizational identifier
3. WHEN sub-administrator is created THEN the system SHALL set up default permissions and access levels
4. WHEN creating sub-administrator THEN the system SHALL require organization name, contact information, and initial admin credentials

### Data Isolation Management
1. WHEN sub-administrator logs in THEN the system SHALL display only their organization's data (students/instructors/lectures)
2. WHEN sub-administrator performs CRUD operations THEN the system SHALL restrict operations to their own organization's data only
3. WHEN data queries are executed THEN the system SHALL automatically filter by organizational scope
4. WHEN sub-administrator uploads content THEN the system SHALL tag it with their organizational identifier

### System Oversight
1. WHEN super administrator accesses the system THEN the system SHALL provide access to all data across all sub-administrators
2. WHEN super administrator views reports THEN the system SHALL aggregate data from all organizations
3. WHEN super administrator manages permissions THEN the system SHALL allow global permission changes
4. WHEN monitoring system usage THEN the system SHALL provide organization-level analytics

### Logo and Branding Management
1. WHEN sub-administrator uploads a logo THEN the system SHALL display it to both administrators and users within their scope
2. WHEN logo is uploaded THEN the system SHALL validate file format (PNG, JPG, SVG) and size (max 2MB)
3. WHEN branding is applied THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent display across all user interfaces
4. WHEN sub-administrator changes branding THEN the system SHALL update all relevant interfaces immediately

## Business Rules

### Organizational Hierarchy
- Super administrator has unrestricted access to all system functions
- Sub-administrators cannot view or modify other organizations' data
- Each organization maintains separate user bases and content libraries
- Cross-organizational data sharing requires super administrator approval

### Security Requirements
- All organizational data must be logically separated in database
- API calls must include organizational context for proper filtering
- Audit logs must track cross-organizational access attempts
- Sub-administrator permissions cannot exceed super administrator settings

## Technical Requirements

### Database Design
- Implement multi-tenant architecture with organizational partitioning
- Use row-level security for data isolation
- Maintain referential integrity within organizational boundaries
- Implement soft delete for data recovery capabilities

### API Security
- JWT tokens must include organizational scope
- All endpoints must validate organizational access rights
- Implement rate limiting per organization
- Log all administrative actions for audit purposes

## Success Metrics
- Sub-administrator creation time < 5 minutes
- Zero cross-organizational data leakage incidents
- 100% data isolation compliance in security audits
- Sub-administrator onboarding completion rate > 90%

## Dependencies
- User authentication system
- Role-based access control (RBAC) implementation
- Multi-tenant database architecture
- Audit logging system
