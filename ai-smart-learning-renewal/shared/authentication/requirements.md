# Multi-Role Authentication System Requirements

## Feature Overview
Comprehensive authentication system supporting multiple user roles (Super Administrator, Sub-Administrator, Instructor, Student) with organizational isolation, secure password management, and role-based access control.

## User Story
As a system user, I want to securely authenticate and access appropriate system functions based on my role and organizational affiliation, so that I can perform my responsibilities while maintaining data security and proper access control.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Multi-Role Authentication
1. WHEN users log in THEN the system SHALL authenticate based on role (Super Admin, Sub-Admin, Instructor, Student) and redirect to appropriate interface
2. WHEN authentication occurs THEN the system SHALL validate credentials against SHA256 encrypted passwords with proper salting
3. WHEN login is successful THEN the system SHALL generate secure session tokens with role and organizational context
4. WHEN role-based access is required THEN the system SHALL enforce permissions based on user role and organizational scope
5. WHEN session expires THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication and clear all session data

### Organizational Isolation
1. WHEN sub-administrators log in THEN the system SHALL establish organizational context and isolate data access
2. WHEN instructors authenticate THEN the system SHALL limit access to their assigned students within organizational scope
3. WHEN students log in THEN the system SHALL provide access only to their organization's content and assigned materials
4. WHEN cross-organizational access is attempted THEN the system SHALL block access and log security events
5. WHEN organizational context changes THEN the system SHALL update access permissions immediately

### Secure Password Management
1. WHEN passwords are stored THEN the system SHALL use SHA256 encryption with unique salt per password
2. WHEN passwords are displayed THEN the system SHALL show masked format (******) and never reveal actual passwords
3. WHEN passwords are updated THEN the system SHALL invalidate old hashes and generate new encrypted versions
4. WHEN password policies are enforced THEN the system SHALL require minimum complexity standards
5. WHEN password reset is requested THEN the system SHALL provide secure reset mechanism with time-limited tokens

### Login Token System
1. WHEN students are created THEN the system SHALL generate unique login tokens for authentication
2. WHEN login tokens are used THEN the system SHALL validate token authenticity and expiration
3. WHEN tokens expire THEN the system SHALL require token renewal or alternative authentication
4. WHEN token security is compromised THEN the system SHALL provide token revocation and regeneration
5. WHEN multiple authentication methods exist THEN the system SHALL support both password and token-based login

### Session Management
1. WHEN users authenticate THEN the system SHALL create secure sessions with appropriate timeout periods
2. WHEN sessions are active THEN the system SHALL maintain role and organizational context throughout
3. WHEN concurrent sessions occur THEN the system SHALL manage multiple sessions per user appropriately
4. WHEN suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL terminate sessions and require re-authentication
5. WHEN users log out THEN the system SHALL completely clear session data and invalidate tokens

## Business Rules

### Role Hierarchy and Permissions
- Super Administrator: Full system access across all organizations
- Sub-Administrator: Full access within their organization only
- Instructor: Limited access to assigned students within organization
- Student: Access to assigned content and learning materials only

### Authentication Security
- All passwords must be SHA256 encrypted with unique salts
- Login tokens must be cryptographically secure and time-limited
- Session tokens must include role and organizational context
- Failed login attempts must be tracked and rate-limited

### Organizational Data Isolation
- Authentication must establish and maintain organizational context
- Cross-organizational access is prohibited except for Super Administrators
- Data queries must automatically include organizational filtering
- Session context must persist organizational boundaries

## Technical Requirements

### Password Security Implementation
1. WHEN passwords are hashed THEN the system SHALL use SHA256 with cryptographically secure random salts
2. WHEN storing password data THEN the system SHALL never store plaintext passwords
3. WHEN validating passwords THEN the system SHALL compare hashed values with timing-safe comparison
4. WHEN password complexity is checked THEN the system SHALL enforce minimum length and character requirements

### Token Generation and Management
1. WHEN generating login tokens THEN the system SHALL use cryptographically secure random number generation
2. WHEN storing tokens THEN the system SHALL hash tokens and store only hashed versions
3. WHEN validating tokens THEN the system SHALL check expiration and authenticity
4. WHEN revoking tokens THEN the system SHALL immediately invalidate and remove from active token list

### Session Security
1. WHEN creating sessions THEN the system SHALL generate secure session identifiers
2. WHEN storing session data THEN the system SHALL encrypt sensitive session information
3. WHEN transmitting session tokens THEN the system SHALL use secure HTTPS connections only
4. WHEN detecting session anomalies THEN the system SHALL implement automatic session termination

### Multi-Tenant Authentication
1. WHEN authenticating users THEN the system SHALL determine organizational affiliation
2. WHEN establishing sessions THEN the system SHALL include organizational context in session data
3. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL validate organizational access permissions
4. WHEN switching contexts THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication for security

## Authentication Interface Requirements

### Login Interface
- Clean, professional login form with role-appropriate branding
- Support for both username/password and token-based authentication
- Clear error messages for authentication failures
