## Control Hierarchy Implementation

### Super Administrator Master Control
```
Master Control Rules:
- If Super Admin sets tool to OFF → Sub-admins CANNOT enable
- If Super Admin sets tool to ON → Sub-admins CAN choose ON/OFF
- Emergency disable overrides all lower-level settings
- Bulk operations available for efficiency
- Usage monitoring and cost tracking across all organizations
```

### Sub-Administrator Organization Control
```
Organization Control Rules:
- Can only enable tools that Super Admin has enabled
- API key management per organization for cost control
- Tool availability depends on API key functionality
- Can configure tool settings per practice session/assignment
- Usage tracking and billing per organization
```

### Student Access Control
```
Student Access Rules:
- Only sees tools configured for specific session/assignment
- No direct tool management capabilities
- Access controlled by session configuration
- Usage tracked for learning analytics
- Tool availability depends on organizational settings
```

## API Key Management

### Master API Keys (Super Administrator)
- System-wide API keys for basic tool access
- Fallback keys when organizational keys fail
- Cost monitoring and usage limits
- Emergency access and override capabilities

### Organizational API Keys (Sub-Administrator)
- Organization-specific API keys for cost control
- Sub-admin registers and manages their own keys
- Usage tracking and billing per organization
- Tool availability depends on key validity and limits

### API Key Security
- Encrypted storage of all API keys
- Regular key rotation and validation
- Usage monitoring for security and cost control
- Audit logging of all API key operations

## Tool Configuration Per Session

### Practice Session Tool Selection
- Sub-admin selects available tools per session (1-40)
- Tool configuration saved per session
- Students see only configured tools for their session
- Tool usage tracked per session for analytics

### Assignment Tool Selection
- Sub-admin selects tools per assignment (1-10)
- Different tool sets possible per assignment
- Tool usage captured for grading and evaluation
- Academic integrity monitoring through tool logs

## Cost Management and Monitoring

### Usage Tracking
- API calls tracked per tool, per organization, per user
- Cost calculation based on provider pricing models
- Real-time usage monitoring and alerts
- Historical usage analysis and reporting

### Budget Controls
- Usage limits per tool per organization
- Cost alerts at configurable thresholds
- Automatic tool disabling when limits exceeded
- Budget planning and forecasting tools

### Billing Integration
- Cost allocation per organization
- Detailed billing reports with usage breakdown
- Integration with organizational billing systems
- Cost optimization recommendations

## Performance and Reliability

### API Performance Monitoring
- Response time tracking per tool and provider
