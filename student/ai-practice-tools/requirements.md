# AI Practice Tools Requirements

## Feature Overview
Student interface for AI-powered practice sessions with integrated tools, prompt analysis, and learning feedback system.

## User Story
As a student, I want to use AI practice tools with intelligent prompt analysis and feedback, so that I can improve my AI interaction skills and learn effectively through guided practice sessions.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Practice Session Access
1. WHEN student accesses practice session THEN the system SHALL display pre-practice guidance message in modal/layer window
2. WHEN guidance is acknowledged THEN the system SHALL load practice interface with configured AI tools only
3. WHEN session loads THEN the system SHALL display tool selection dropdown with administrator-configured options
4. WHEN practice session starts THEN the system SHALL initialize assistant-ui.com interface components
5. WHEN session is accessed THEN the system SHALL validate student permissions and organizational scope

### AI Tool Integration
1. WHEN using practice tools THEN the system SHALL integrate with https://www.assistant-ui.com/ for consistent UI experience
2. WHEN tool selection changes THEN the system SHALL dynamically load appropriate AI service endpoints
3. WHEN AI tools are unavailable THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages and fallback options
4. WHEN practice session ends THEN the system SHALL save tool usage data and session progress
5. WHEN tools are configured THEN the system SHALL respect sub-administrator's session-specific tool selections

### Prompt Analysis and Feedback
1. WHEN student enters prompts THEN the system SHALL analyze input using GPT API for improvement suggestions
2. WHEN prompt analysis completes THEN the system SHALL display feedback in dedicated panel showing: clarity issues, missing context, improvement suggestions
3. WHEN analysis identifies problems THEN the system SHALL highlight specific areas: unclear targets, missing details, time constraints, format specifications, safety/ethics considerations
4. WHEN improvements are suggested THEN the system SHALL provide specific, actionable recommendations
5. WHEN prompt is well-structured THEN the system SHALL provide positive reinforcement and advanced tips

### Practice Interface Features
1. WHEN using practice interface THEN the system SHALL provide real-time prompt input with Enter or Ctrl+Enter submission
2. WHEN interacting with AI THEN the system SHALL display conversation history with clear user/AI message distinction
3. WHEN session is active THEN the system SHALL provide session controls: reset history, save progress, export conversation
4. WHEN practice tools respond THEN the system SHALL display results in appropriate format (text, images, files)
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide helpful error messages and recovery suggestions

### Learning Progress Tracking
1. WHEN practice session is used THEN the system SHALL track: session duration, prompts entered, tools used, improvements made
2. WHEN session completes THEN the system SHALL save progress data for instructor and administrator review
3. WHEN multiple sessions are completed THEN the system SHALL show progress trends and skill development
4. WHEN feedback is provided THEN the system SHALL track which suggestions were implemented by student
5. WHEN learning goals are set THEN the system SHALL measure progress against objectives

## Business Rules

### Session Configuration
- Only tools configured by sub-administrator for specific session are available
- Pre-practice messages are mandatory and must be acknowledged before tool access
- Session URLs are unique per organization and include security validation
- Tool availability depends on super administrator's master control settings

### Prompt Analysis Standards
- Analysis focuses on: clarity, specificity, context completeness, format requirements, ethical considerations
- Feedback is constructive and educational, not just critical
- Suggestions are actionable and include examples where helpful
- Analysis respects student privacy and doesn't store sensitive prompt content

### Progress and Privacy
- Student progress data is isolated by organization
- Conversation history can be cleared by student at any time
- Sensitive or personal information in prompts is not permanently stored
- Analytics focus on learning patterns, not content details

## Technical Requirements

### Assistant UI Integration
1. WHEN integrating assistant-ui.com THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent styling with existing platform
2. WHEN UI components load THEN the system SHALL ensure responsive design across devices
3. WHEN customizing interface THEN the system SHALL preserve accessibility features and keyboard navigation
4. WHEN updating UI THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing sessions

### GPT API Integration for Analysis
1. WHEN analyzing prompts THEN the system SHALL use dedicated GPT API endpoint for educational feedback
2. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL implement proper rate limiting and error handling
3. WHEN analysis results are returned THEN the system SHALL format feedback for optimal learning experience
4. WHEN API costs are incurred THEN the system SHALL track usage per organization for billing purposes

### Real-time Performance
1. WHEN prompts are submitted THEN AI responses SHALL appear within 5 seconds under normal conditions
2. WHEN analysis is performed THEN feedback SHALL be available within 3 seconds of prompt submission
3. WHEN switching tools THEN interface SHALL update within 2 seconds
4. WHEN session data is saved THEN confirmation SHALL appear within 1 second

### Security and Privacy
1. WHEN handling student data THEN the system SHALL encrypt all communications and storage
2. WHEN processing prompts THEN the system SHALL not log sensitive personal information
3. WHEN session expires THEN the system SHALL securely clear temporary data
4. WHEN exporting conversations THEN the system SHALL remove any sensitive metadata
