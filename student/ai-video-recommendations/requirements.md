# AI Video Recommendations Requirements

## Feature Overview
Student interface for AI-powered video recommendations through chatbot conversation, providing personalized learning content based on job experience and learning needs using RAG methodology.

## User Story
As a student, I want to receive personalized video recommendations through AI chatbot conversation, so that I can get relevant learning content tailored to my job experience and learning objectives.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AI Chatbot Conversation (Step 1)
1. WHEN student starts video recommendation process THEN the system SHALL display initial message configured by sub-administrator
2. WHEN initial message is shown THEN the system SHALL personalize greeting with student name and session content
3. WHEN student provides job/experience information THEN the system SHALL analyze context using AI to determine learning needs
4. WHEN AI needs more information THEN the system SHALL generate follow-up questions about practical experience and learning goals
5. WHEN sufficient information is gathered THEN the system SHALL proceed to generate video recommendations using RAG methodology

### Video Recommendation Generation (RAG Implementation)
1. WHEN AI analyzes student input THEN the system SHALL query video database using script content and hashtags registered by administrators
2. WHEN applying RAG methodology THEN the system SHALL match student context against video metadata for relevance scoring
3. WHEN generating recommendations THEN the system SHALL prioritize videos based on: job relevance, experience level, learning objectives, content difficulty
4. WHEN recommendations are created THEN the system SHALL provide diverse content covering different aspects of the topic
5. WHEN no suitable content is found THEN the system SHALL suggest basic lectures or request administrator to add relevant content

### Video Selection and Configuration (Step 2)
1. WHEN AI recommendations are displayed THEN the system SHALL show video list with titles, descriptions, and duration
2. WHEN student reviews options THEN the system SHALL allow manual addition and removal of videos from recommendation list
3. WHEN total duration is calculated THEN the system SHALL require minimum 5 minutes of selected content
4. WHEN duration is insufficient THEN the system SHALL offer auto-select function to randomly add videos to meet minimum requirement
5. WHEN selection is complete THEN the system SHALL confirm final video playlist and proceed to learning phase

### Learning Experience (Step 3)
1. WHEN learning phase starts THEN the system SHALL load video playlist with same structure as current system
2. WHEN videos are played THEN the system SHALL track progress, display comments, and show like counts
3. WHEN student interacts with content THEN the system SHALL record engagement metrics for future recommendation improvement
4. WHEN videos are completed THEN the system SHALL update learning progress and provide completion confirmation
5. WHEN session ends THEN the system SHALL save learning history and prepare data for future personalization

### Personalization and Learning History
1. WHEN student completes recommendation sessions THEN the system SHALL store learning preferences and content effectiveness
2. WHEN future recommendations are generated THEN the system SHALL consider previous selections and completion rates
3. WHEN analyzing learning patterns THEN the system SHALL identify preferred content types and learning styles
4. WHEN content effectiveness is measured THEN the system SHALL adjust recommendation algorithms based on student outcomes
5. WHEN learning goals evolve THEN the system SHALL adapt recommendations to changing student needs and progress

## Business Rules

### Content Scope and Access
- Video recommendations are limited to content registered by student's organization
- Cross-organizational content sharing requires super administrator approval
- AI recommendations respect organizational content policies and restrictions
- Student access is controlled by enrollment status and organizational membership

### RAG Methodology Implementation
- Video script content and hashtags are processed for semantic search
- Student input is analyzed for context extraction and intent recognition
- Relevance scoring combines multiple factors: job match, experience level, content difficulty
- Recommendation diversity ensures comprehensive coverage of learning objectives

### Learning Progress Integration
- Video recommendations integrate with overall learning path and lecture assignments
- Completion of recommended videos contributes to course progress and requirements
- Learning analytics feed back into recommendation algorithm improvement
- Student preferences influence future content suggestions and learning paths

## Technical Requirements

### AI Chatbot Integration
1. WHEN processing student input THEN the system SHALL use natural language processing to extract job context and learning needs
2. WHEN generating responses THEN the system SHALL maintain conversational flow while gathering necessary information
3. WHEN conversation concludes THEN the system SHALL have sufficient data for accurate content matching
4. WHEN chatbot interactions occur THEN the system SHALL maintain session state and conversation history

### RAG System Implementation
1. WHEN video content is registered THEN the system SHALL process script content for semantic embeddings
2. WHEN hashtags are added THEN the system SHALL create searchable metadata for content discovery
3. WHEN student queries are processed THEN the system SHALL perform semantic search against video content database
4. WHEN relevance scores are calculated THEN the system SHALL combine semantic similarity with contextual factors

### Video Content Processing
1. WHEN administrators register videos THEN the system SHALL extract and process script content for AI analysis
2. WHEN hashtags are assigned THEN the system SHALL validate and standardize tags for consistent searching
3. WHEN content is updated THEN the system SHALL re-process for updated recommendations
4. WHEN new content is added THEN the system SHALL immediately become available for recommendations

### Performance and Scalability
1. WHEN AI processing occurs THEN the system SHALL respond within 5 seconds for recommendation generation
2. WHEN multiple students use system simultaneously THEN the system SHALL maintain performance without degradation
3. WHEN large content libraries are searched THEN the system SHALL use efficient indexing and caching strategies
4. WHEN recommendation algorithms run THEN the system SHALL optimize for both accuracy and speed
