# AI API Master Control Requirements

## Feature Overview
Super administrator capability to control AI tool availability system-wide, managing approximately 100 AI tools with hierarchical permission structure.

## User Story
As a super administrator, I want to control AI tool availability system-wide, so that I can manage platform capabilities, costs, and ensure appropriate feature access across all organizations.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Master Control System
1. WHEN super administrator disables an AI tool THEN sub-administrators SHALL NOT be able to enable it for their organizations
2. WHEN super administrator enables an AI tool THEN sub-administrators SHALL have the option to enable/disable it within their organization
3. WHEN managing AI tools THEN the system SHALL display hierarchical control structure (Master → Organization → User)
4. WHEN bulk operations are performed THEN the system SHALL support enabling/disabling multiple tools simultaneously

### AI Tool Management Interface
1. WHEN accessing AI API management THEN the system SHALL display approximately 100 available AI tools
2. WHEN viewing tool status THEN the system SHALL show: Tool Name, Provider, Master Status, Usage Count, Cost Impact
3. WHEN filtering tools THEN the system SHALL support filtering by: Provider, Category, Status, Usage Level
4. WHEN searching tools THEN the system SHALL provide real-time search across tool names and descriptions

### Hierarchical Permission Enforcement
1. WHEN sub-administrator attempts to enable disabled tool THEN the system SHALL prevent activation and show master restriction message
2. WHEN master setting changes THEN the system SHALL immediately propagate changes to all sub-administrator interfaces
3. WHEN tool is disabled at master level THEN all active sessions using that tool SHALL be gracefully terminated
4. WHEN permission conflicts occur THEN master level settings SHALL always take precedence

### Cost and Usage Monitoring
1. WHEN viewing tool analytics THEN the system SHALL display usage statistics across all organizations
2. WHEN monitoring costs THEN the system SHALL show estimated API costs per tool and organization
3. WHEN usage thresholds are exceeded THEN the system SHALL send alerts to super administrator
4. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide detailed usage and cost breakdowns

## Business Rules

### Tool Categories
- **Core AI Tools**: Essential tools that should remain available (GPT models, basic NLP)
- **Specialized Tools**: Advanced features that may have cost implications (image generation, video processing)
- **Experimental Tools**: Beta or testing tools that may be unstable
- **Premium Tools**: High-cost tools requiring special approval

### Permission Hierarchy
- Master OFF → Organization cannot enable → Users cannot access
- Master ON → Organization can choose → Users see organization choice
- Emergency disable overrides all lower-level permissions
- Tool deprecation requires 30-day notice to organizations

### Cost Management
- Track API usage per organization for billing purposes
- Set usage limits per tool per organization
- Implement cost alerts at 80% and 100% of budget thresholds
- Provide cost estimation tools for organizations

## Technical Requirements

### API Integration Management
1. WHEN integrating new AI tools THEN the system SHALL support standardized API wrapper interface
2. WHEN tool APIs change THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility where possible
3. WHEN API keys are managed THEN the system SHALL support both master keys and organization-specific keys
4. WHEN rate limiting occurs THEN the system SHALL implement fair usage policies across organizations

### Real-time Synchronization
1. WHEN master settings change THEN updates SHALL propagate to all active sessions within 30 seconds
2. WHEN tools are disabled THEN active users SHALL receive graceful shutdown notifications
3. WHEN new tools are added THEN they SHALL appear in organization interfaces immediately
4. WHEN system maintenance occurs THEN affected tools SHALL show maintenance status

### Monitoring and Logging
1. WHEN tools are used THEN the system SHALL log: Organization, User, Tool, Duration, API Calls, Costs
2. WHEN permission changes occur THEN the system SHALL maintain audit trail with timestamps and reasons
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for troubleshooting
4. WHEN generating analytics THEN the system SHALL provide real-time and historical data views
