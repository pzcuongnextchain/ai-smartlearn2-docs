# AI Tool Configuration Requirements

## Feature Overview
Sub-administrator capability to configure AI tools for their organization, including API key management, tool selection per session/assignment, and cost control within master administrator constraints.

## User Story
As a sub-administrator, I want to configure AI tools and manage API keys for my organization, so that I can control costs, customize learning experiences, and provide appropriate AI tools for different educational contexts.

## Acceptance Criteria

### API Key Management
1. WHEN sub-administrator registers API keys THEN the system SHALL store them securely with encryption for their organization
2. WHEN API keys are entered THEN the system SHALL validate keys with respective AI service providers
3. WHEN API keys are invalid or expired THEN the system SHALL automatically disable related tools and notify administrator
4. WHEN API key usage approaches limits THEN the system SHALL send cost and usage alerts
5. WHEN API keys are updated THEN the system SHALL seamlessly transition to new keys without service interruption

### Organization-Level Tool Control
1. WHEN configuring tools THEN the system SHALL show only tools enabled by super administrator master control
2. WHEN enabling tools THEN the system SHALL require valid API keys for tool activation
3. WHEN tools are disabled THEN the system SHALL immediately remove access for all students and sessions
4. WHEN tool status changes THEN the system SHALL update all active sessions and notify affected users
5. WHEN managing tools THEN the system SHALL provide usage analytics and cost tracking per tool

### Session-Specific Tool Configuration
1. WHEN configuring practice sessions (1-40) THEN the system SHALL allow selection of available tools per session
2. WHEN setting up assignments (1-10) THEN the system SHALL enable different tool combinations per assignment
3. WHEN tools are configured for sessions THEN the system SHALL validate tool availability and permissions
4. WHEN students access sessions THEN the system SHALL display only tools configured for that specific session
5. WHEN session tools are updated THEN the system SHALL apply changes to future sessions while preserving active ones



## Business Rules

### Master Control Compliance
- Sub-administrators can only enable tools that super administrator has enabled
- Tool availability depends on both master control settings and valid API keys
- Emergency tool disables by super administrator override all organizational settings
- New tools added by super administrator become available for organizational configuration

### Cost Control (from docs.txt)
- Sub-administrators register their own API keys to handle token cost issues
- API key management allows organizations to control their own costs
- Each organization manages their own API expenses through their registered keys

### Educational Context Configuration
- Different tool sets can be configured for practice sessions vs assignments
- Tool selection should align with learning objectives and session complexity
- Advanced tools can be restricted to higher-level sessions or assignments
- Tool configuration should consider student skill levels and learning progression

## Technical Requirements

### Secure API Key Storage
1. WHEN API keys are stored THEN the system SHALL use industry-standard encryption (AES-256)
2. WHEN keys are accessed THEN the system SHALL implement secure key retrieval with audit logging
3. WHEN keys are transmitted THEN the system SHALL use encrypted connections and secure protocols
4. WHEN keys are rotated THEN the system SHALL support seamless key updates without service disruption

### Real-time Tool Management
1. WHEN tool configurations change THEN the system SHALL propagate updates to all relevant sessions within 30 seconds
2. WHEN API keys fail THEN the system SHALL detect failures and disable tools within 60 seconds
3. WHEN tools are enabled/disabled THEN the system SHALL update student interfaces immediately
4. WHEN monitoring tool status THEN the system SHALL provide real-time health checks and status updates

### Usage Tracking and Analytics
1. WHEN tools are used THEN the system SHALL log detailed usage metrics including duration, success rate, and costs
2. WHEN calculating costs THEN the system SHALL integrate with AI provider pricing models for accurate billing
3. WHEN generating analytics THEN the system SHALL provide real-time and historical usage data
4. WHEN tracking performance THEN the system SHALL monitor response times, error rates, and user satisfaction

### Integration with AI Services
1. WHEN integrating tools THEN the system SHALL support multiple AI service providers and APIs
2. WHEN routing requests THEN the system SHALL implement load balancing and failover mechanisms
3. WHEN handling responses THEN the system SHALL normalize outputs across different AI providers
4. WHEN managing connections THEN the system SHALL implement connection pooling and rate limiting

## AI Tool Configuration Interface Requirements

### API Key Management Interface
- Secure key entry forms with validation and testing capabilities
- Key status dashboard showing validity, usage, and expiration information
- Bulk key management for organizations using multiple AI services
- Key rotation and update workflows with minimal service disruption

### Tool Selection and Configuration
- Visual tool catalog with descriptions, capabilities, and cost information
- Session-based configuration interface for practice sessions (1-40) and assignments (1-10)
- Drag-and-drop tool assignment with visual session/assignment mapping
- Tool testing and preview capabilities for configuration validation

### Cost Management Dashboard
- Real-time cost tracking with visual charts and usage trends
- Budget setting and threshold configuration with alert management
- Cost optimization recommendations based on usage patterns
- Detailed cost reports with export capabilities for financial analysis

### Performance Monitoring Interface
- Tool performance dashboard with response times, success rates, and availability metrics
- Alert management for tool failures, slow responses, and service issues
- Usage analytics showing tool effectiveness and student engagement
- Comparative analysis of different tools and their educational impact

## Integration Requirements

### Master Control Integration
- Real-time synchronization with super administrator master control settings
- Automatic tool availability updates when master settings change
- Compliance checking to ensure organizational settings don't exceed master permissions
- Escalation procedures for requesting new tools or increased permissions

### Session and Assignment Integration
- Direct integration with practice session management (1-40 sessions)
- Seamless connection with assignment system (1-10 assignments)
- Tool availability propagation to student interfaces based on session configuration
- Progress tracking integration showing tool usage effectiveness in learning outcomes

### Financial and Billing Integration
- Integration with organizational billing and accounting systems
- Cost allocation and chargeback capabilities for different departments or programs
- Budget management integration with organizational financial planning
- Automated billing and invoice generation based on AI tool usage

### Learning Analytics Integration
- Tool usage data integration with overall learning analytics platform
- Correlation analysis between tool usage and learning outcomes
- Student engagement tracking across different AI tools and sessions
- Effectiveness measurement for different tool configurations and educational contexts

## Success Metrics
- API key validation success rate > 99%
- Tool configuration propagation time < 30 seconds
- Cost tracking accuracy > 99.5%
