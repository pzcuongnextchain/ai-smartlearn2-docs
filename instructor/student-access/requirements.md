# Instructor Student Access Requirements

## Feature Overview
Instructor capability to view and manage their assigned students with limited system access, based on docs.txt Page 6 specification.

## User Story
As an instructor, I want to view and manage my assigned students, so that I can fulfill my teaching responsibilities while having restricted access to only my designated students.

## Requirements from docs.txt

### Core Specification (Page 6)
Based on docs.txt: "However, when an instructor logs in, they should not see other menus and should only be able to view their own students (same as current)"

## Acceptance Criteria

### Limited System Access
1. WHEN instructor logs in THEN the system SHALL hide all other menus except student access
2. WHEN instructor accesses the system THEN the system SHALL display only student-related functions
3. WHEN instructor attempts to access other features THEN the system SHALL block access and show access restriction message
4. WHEN instructor navigates the system THEN the system SHALL maintain the same interface as current system
5. WHEN instructor session is active THEN the system SHALL continuously enforce access restrictions

### Student View Access
1. WHEN instructor views students THEN the system SHALL display only students assigned to them by sub-administrator
2. WHEN instructor accesses student information THEN the system SHALL show student details within their scope
3. WHEN instructor manages students THEN the system SHALL allow operations only on assigned students
4. WHEN instructor views student lists THEN the system SHALL filter data to show only their assigned students
5. WHEN instructor performs student operations THEN the system SHALL maintain organizational scope restrictions

### Access Control Implementation
1. WHEN instructor authentication occurs THEN the system SHALL apply instructor-specific UI restrictions
2. WHEN instructor requests data THEN the system SHALL automatically filter to assigned students only
3. WHEN instructor attempts unauthorized access THEN the system SHALL log attempt and deny access
4. WHEN instructor permissions are checked THEN the system SHALL validate against student assignments
5. WHEN instructor session expires THEN the system SHALL clear all cached student data

### Student Learning Progress Access (from docs.txt Page 5)
1. WHEN instructor clicks "학습보기" (Learning View) THEN the system SHALL display the list of AI-recommended video lectures (same as before)
2. WHEN instructor clicks "과제보기" (Assignment View) THEN the system SHALL show the content of practice tools used and assignments
3. WHEN instructor views practice tool usage THEN the system SHALL display only the "Use AI tool" page content (updated version)
4. WHEN instructor views assignment work THEN the system SHALL display only the "Use AI tool" page content (updated version)
5. WHEN instructor accesses student work THEN the system SHALL show AI tool usage history and chat logs within their scope

### Integration with Sub-Administrator Management
1. WHEN sub-administrator assigns students THEN the system SHALL update instructor access permissions
2. WHEN student assignments change THEN the system SHALL immediately reflect changes in instructor interface
3. WHEN instructor access is modified THEN the system SHALL update available student lists in real-time
4. WHEN organizational changes occur THEN the system SHALL maintain instructor access restrictions
5. WHEN instructor accounts are updated THEN the system SHALL preserve student assignment relationships

## Business Rules

### Access Restrictions
- Instructors can only access students assigned to them by sub-administrators
- No access to administrative functions or other organizational features
- All system menus except student access are hidden or disabled
- Interface maintains same functionality as current system

### Data Scope Limitations
- Student data is filtered to show only instructor's assigned students
- Cross-organizational access is completely prohibited
- Instructor cannot view other instructors' students
- All operations are scoped to assigned student list only

### Current System Compatibility
- Maintain same interface and functionality as existing system
- Preserve existing instructor workflows and processes
- Ensure seamless transition from current system
- Keep familiar navigation and user experience

## Technical Requirements

### Authentication and Authorization
1. WHEN instructor authenticates THEN the system SHALL establish instructor-specific session context
2. WHEN authorization is checked THEN the system SHALL validate against assigned student list
3. WHEN permissions are enforced THEN the system SHALL apply instructor-level restrictions
4. WHEN session management occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain instructor access scope

### Data Filtering Implementation
1. WHEN database queries are executed THEN the system SHALL automatically include instructor assignment filters
2. WHEN student data is retrieved THEN the system SHALL limit results to assigned students only
3. WHEN reports are generated THEN the system SHALL scope data to instructor's student cohort
4. WHEN analytics are calculated THEN the system SHALL process only assigned student data

### User Interface Restrictions
1. WHEN instructor interface loads THEN the system SHALL hide non-student-related menu items
2. WHEN navigation is rendered THEN the system SHALL show only permitted functions
3. WHEN unauthorized features are accessed THEN the system SHALL redirect to allowed areas
4. WHEN interface updates occur THEN the system SHALL maintain access restrictions

### Integration with Student Management
1. WHEN student assignments change THEN the system SHALL update instructor access in real-time
2. WHEN new students are assigned THEN the system SHALL immediately grant access to instructor
3. WHEN students are removed THEN the system SHALL revoke instructor access immediately
4. WHEN bulk assignment changes occur THEN the system SHALL process updates efficiently

## Instructor Interface Requirements

### Student List Interface
- Display assigned students with key information (Name, ID, Course Schedule)
- Search and filter capabilities within assigned student scope
- Quick access to individual student details and progress
- Bulk operations for assigned students only

### Student Detail Interface
- Comprehensive view of individual student information
- Learning progress and activity history
- Assignment and practice tool usage
- Communication and note-taking capabilities

### Restricted Navigation
- Simplified menu structure showing only student-related functions
- Clear indication of instructor role and access limitations
- Breadcrumb navigation within permitted areas
- Help and support specific to instructor capabilities

### Current System Compatibility
- Maintain existing instructor interface design and layout
- Preserve familiar workflows and user interactions
- Keep same functionality as current system
- Ensure smooth transition with minimal learning curve

## Integration Requirements

### Sub-Administrator Integration
- Real-time synchronization with student assignment changes
- Coordination with sub-administrator user management functions
- Proper handling of instructor account modifications
- Integration with organizational permission systems

### Student Data Integration (from docs.txt)
- Access to AI-recommended video lecture lists for assigned students

- View AI tool usage history and chat interaction logs

### Authentication System Integration
- Coordination with multi-role authentication system
- Proper session management and timeout handling
- Integration with organizational access control
- Security logging and audit trail maintenance

## Success Metrics
